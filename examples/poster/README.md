# Backend.js sample of a poster image creation

The goal is to implement server side rendering using sharp.js, the image is created by the backend.

But for fun i vibe-coded a browser only poster creation using Codex in the file `web/vibe-poster.html`,
the logic is vanilla Javascript with Bootstrap5 and Alpine.js.

1. Run the app

        npm run start

2. Point browser to http://localhost:8000
